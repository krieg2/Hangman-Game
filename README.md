# Hangman-Game

[Link to game on github pages.](https://krieg2.github.io/Hangman-Game)

This is an island themed hangman game where the user guesses letters on the board until the correct answer is guessed or until there are no guesses remaining. By default 14 guesses can be made. Re-typing the same letter doesn't count. The bottom of the page will display a list of the letters previously guessed in the current game. If the game ends and the word has not been guessed, a new game begins. If the user wins the game, the score is updated, a random sound plays, and a flag of the island's country is displayed.
